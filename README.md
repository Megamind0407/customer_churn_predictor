# Customer Churn Prediction System
This is a **Customer Churn Prediction System** built with **Streamlit**, **Machine Learning**, and **Sentiment Analysis**. The system allows users to predict customer churn based on their subscription data and provides personalized intervention recommendations. It also includes an optional sentiment analysis of customer feedback.

## üöÄ Features

- **Churn Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of a customer churning based on features like subscription type, tenure, and services used.
- **Risk Score Calculation**: Calculate a risk score based on the churn probability and customer feedback sentiment.
- **Intervention Recommendations**: Suggest interventions (e.g., discounts, technical support) based on the customer's risk profile.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback to adjust the risk profile.
- **Data Upload**: Upload customer data in CSV format to make predictions for specific customers.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to allow easy input and data visualization.
